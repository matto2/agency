          FastPencil is a web-based publishing platform that allows authors,
          publishers, and enterprises to create books in print and EPUB formats
          and have them distributed online on all major book selling channels
          including Amazon and Ingram. While I was leading design there it
          became necessary to rebuild the front-end technology and UI on order
          to offer a white-label version of the platform so I led this effort.

        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Hypothesis</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The original design of the publishing platform was heavily branded
          without the flexibility to allow other companies to easily create a
          version of their own on top of the software. A new design was required
          to enable white-labeling. Also, during the redesign, every effort
          should be made to identify and fix any areas of the app with poor
          usability.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Research</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          As part of a small team, I helped analyze hundreds support tickets to
          discover areas where users were struggling or had questions with what
          to do or would happen next. We also analyzed results of a large survey
          asking customers to provide general feedback on the service.

        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>There are too many choices per view.</li>
            <li>
              Users don't know what to do at key junctions in the publishing
              process.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          I created an html prototype with Bootstrap that with an emphasis on
          simplicity and making the most common actions visually prominent while
          still supporting other possible flows. Along with the CEO I presented
          this prototype to many prospective customers and investors. Based on
          their feedback and questions I iterated on the prototype and tracked
          reactions to changes.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Development</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          I worked closely with the development team to build out the production
          versions - both the FastPencil (self-branded version) as well as the
          white-label/ brandable version.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Outcome</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          FastPencil was successfully acquired by Courier Corporation in large
          part based on the design and usability improvements that I made to the
          web UI and experience.
