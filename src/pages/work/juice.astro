      When Desktop Publishing, Zines, and Surfing collided they formed the Juice
      Magazine! As co-founder (along with Eric Mitchell) I learned a ton about
      design, surf photography, the surf-biz, and what it takes to run a small
      ad-supported publication.

      Directly from our media kit: "The Juice is Northern California's Surf
      Magazine. Published 4 times a year by O-M productions in Santa Cruz, we
      are in our sixth year. The Juice is a quality publication concentrating on
      the high performance, professional, and recreational surfing found in this
      wave-rich part of California. Our editorial features the region's hottest
      surfers in action photos and interviews. We feature travel articles, and
      crossover sports like snowboarding and skateboarding. Also inside are
      timely surf news issues as well as fictional stories. Currently we print
      over 5000 issues which are distributed free at quality surf shops in
      Northern California."
