        For this project, I had the pleasure of designing and developing a
        custom website for Jack Pitts, a talented photographer based in San
        Francisco. The site showcases his stunning photography through a clean,
        modern design that emphasizes his portfolio with full-screen galleries
        and seamless navigation. Using Astro and Tailwind CSS, I created a fast,
        responsive website optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. The
        project was especially rewarding as it allowed me to bring Jack's
        creative vision to life while ensuring a smooth user experience.
        Throughout the process, I collaborated closely with Jack to ensure that
        the design matched his aesthetic and professional goals.
