          While at Wiser Solutions I did a major upgrade to the design and
          usability of Live Price Check. Live Price Check (LPC) is a Chrome
          extension that allows retailers and brands to compare prices of
          selected products across all the other online shopping platforms in
          that particular country or region-all without having to manually visit
          every other site where the product is sold. It also provides a price
          history chart to track price trends over time.

          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">The Challenge</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Although the original product has a ton of utility, it is not easy
            to learn and requires a lot of training by the customer success team
            to teach customers how to use the product.
          </p>
          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">The Process</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            My process was to deeply analyze the product and check against best
            practices in UI and user experience design. Plus a lot of research!
            The product manager and I talked to several customers who used the
            product daily and gathered their extremely insightful and valuable
            feedback. From there I started to create the new designs.

          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Key Improvements</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>Added product photo to description</li>
              <li>
                Added blue frame to selected product (which is mirrored in the
                side panel)
              </li>
              <li>
                Dashed-lines around products (more obvious it's related to the
                extension)
              </li>
              <li>Added amber color to indicate pricing in the middle</li>
              <li>Added the price delta</li>
              <li>
                Green and red coloring in side panel to indicate higher and
                lower prices
              </li>
              <li>
                Added a button to trigger the price history chart- the
                mini-chart at the bottom did not look clickable
              </li>
              <li>Improved readability overall:</li>
              <ul class="list-none pl-5 space-y-2 mb-12">
                <li>-Larger fonts</li>
                <li>-Changed text from all-caps to title or sentence-case</li>
                <li>-Increased contrast</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <div class="md:flex md:space-x-10 mt-6">

          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Key Improvements to Chart</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Strong splash of color to connect retailer name to line in chart
              </li>
              <li>
                Show selected product (picture and name) to maintain context
              </li>
              <li>Added chart title</li>
              <li>Added date range</li>
              <li>Added bold styling on selected site</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Outcome</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The Improvements outlined above, along with other improvements,
            resulted in:

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Delighted customers! One customer for example called the changes
                to the way the product rankings are displayed as "Brilliant!"
              </li>
              <li>
                Less "hand-holding" by support staff because the extension is
                now way more self-explanatory/intuitive resulting in an about a
                50% drop in support tickets related to how to use the extension.
              </li>
            </ul>
