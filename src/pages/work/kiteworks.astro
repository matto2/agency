      While at Kiteworks-a secure file sharing and collaboration platform-I
      redesigned the entire web application interface, resulting in faster and
      smoother adoption, higher engagement, and reduced churn.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Background</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Kiteworks was founded as a secure file transfer app and gained a loyal
      following based its feature set and performance. Around 2014, the company
      launched a new product called kiteworks that focused more on folder
      sharing than the original product with the thought that customers of the
      legacy product would migrate and adapt to new ways of collaboration.
      Although file transfer was still part of the new product, customers
      complained about usability and many stayed with the aging original product
      rather than switching over.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Hypothesis</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The kiteworks app did not initially meet the needs of customers migrating
      from the original file sharing application. There were several usability
      issues related to file sharing. A redesign of the feature is required to
      clarify what users can do and reduce friction throughout the task flow.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Research</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      As part of the discovery process and to achieve a deep understanding of
      customer needs and flows I helped organize and ran a week-long usability
      study with the city of Pleasanton, California - a key government customer.
    </p>

      alt="Kiteworks research example"
    />
  </p> -->
    <p class="mb-2">
      Each day I met with employees from various departments within the city:
      planning, police, fire, business development, IT and more. The individuals
      I met with had varying levels of experience using the product, from zero
      experience to power users. The goal of the project was to understand the
      behaviors and needs of a representative customer to improve the product
      for all customers and inform product design decisions going forward. The
      sessions took place in the users own environment and context to learn how
      they are using the product and where they are having issues. Sessions
      started with a casual interview followed by observation of the users going
      through a series of common tasks. The project revealed a wealth of issues
      that would not have been discovered without this deep level of testing.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="list-disc list-inside">
        The Send File icon (an airplane logo) by itself in inline actions on
        files was not clear to users.
      </li>
      <li class="list-disc list-inside">
        Received files were hidden under the Send Files drop down. Users didn't
        expect to find it there.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Sketching/Prototyping</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Based on feedback I decided to test a clear, unambiguous call-to-action in
      the menu for messaging vs a navigation label that also functioned as an
      action.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>

      class="port"

      alt="sketches for file sharing app"
    />
  </p> -->
    <p class="mb-2">
      Next step was to build a clickable prototype and run it by customers. I
      conducted approximately 10 interviews (primarily over webex) with a
      variety of customers, gathering feedback and making small iterations.
      Example open question was how to visualize files being processed and in
      transit - and how to handle errors (ie outbox or no outbox.)
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Development</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      I worked very closely with the front-end development to build out the
      production version and fine-tuned as we went a long.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Outcome</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The changes were a great success for the business and the benefit of
      customers. Additionally the new visual paradigms were extended to forms
      and request-file modules as well as mobile applications.

      <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Feedback from Kiteworks customers</h4>

        <ul class="text-lg">
          <li class="mb-6 text-indigo-700">
            I like Kiteworks better than Dropbox in a number of ways. Kiteworks
            has a great Web UI to manage the files.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-6 text-indigo-700">
            Kiteworks is very easy to learn and for end-users to use.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-6 text-indigo-700">
            Kiteworks has a very easy to use user-interface. I recommend this
            solution to every company.
