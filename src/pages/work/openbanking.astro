          The Open Banking demo site was a side project within the greater Axway
          organization. It was created by a small, collaborative, and
          cross-functional team led by Eyal Sivan (Mr Open Banking) and I was
          tapped to be the designer. The site features real APIs but with a
          made-up, representative bank and was built to demonstrate to mid-sized
          banks the power of the Axway API platform.

            A majority of the banks that have had a personal demo (as of the
            time of this writing) have signed up for an Open Banking
            Proof-of-Concept engagement with Axway. They are using the front-
            and back-end that we built (but they'll be adding their own bank
            name and branding).
