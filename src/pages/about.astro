          Welcome to Matt O'Leary Design!
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          With a passion for design that spans over 20 years, I have dedicated
          my career to transforming ideas into visually stunning and effective
          solutions. My journey in design began while working at a print shop
          and a buddy said “let’s publish a surf magazine!” That humble
          beginning led to stints at a couple of marketing agencies, as an
          in-house designer for a large retailer, plus product design roles at
          several start-ups and established companies where I was responsible
          for designing, testing, and elevating the user experience of digital
          products. Throughout this time, I have nurtured my own design
          business, taking good care of the creative needs of my clients.
