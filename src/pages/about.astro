            I've worked across agencies, in-house teams, and startups, handling
            everything from brand development and campaign design to production
            design and prepress. I have experience adapting conceptual designs
            for print, packaging, and signage, and fine-tuning creative
            workflows for consistency and efficiency. Whether I'm managing
            creative services, building out a design system, or optimizing a
            landing page, I focus on delivering work that's both effective and
            execution-ready.

            When I'm not designing, I'm probably in the ocean. I've been surfing
            since I was a kid and still get out whenever I can. I love exploring
            the outdoors with my family, and I paint and play music (fiddle and
            ukulele) in my spare time. You can see some of my artwork at <a
