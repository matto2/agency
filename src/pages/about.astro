            I’m a seasoned designer with a passion for creating visually
            compelling and effective marketing solutions. My experience spans
            marketing agencies, in-house design for a large retailer, and
            working with startups, where I’ve developed impactful branding and
            graphic design for digital and print media. I specialize in
            optimizing websites and marketing materials for conversion, using
            strategic design, SEO principles, and lead generation tactics to
            drive engagement. By blending creativity with data-driven marketing
            strategies, I help businesses enhance their brand and connect with
            their customers.
